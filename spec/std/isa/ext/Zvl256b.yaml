long_name: Vector register length must be at least 256 bits
description: |
  The Zvl256b extension requires the implementation to have a vector register
  length (VLEN) of at least 256 bits.

  The Zvl*b extensions are a family of extensions that specify minimum vector
  register lengths. They allow software to determine the minimum VLEN supported
  by an implementation without needing to probe at runtime.

  With VLEN=256 and SEW=8 bits, VLMAX is 32 elements (with LMUL=1).
