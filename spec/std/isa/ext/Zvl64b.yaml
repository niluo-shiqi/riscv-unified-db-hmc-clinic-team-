long_name: Vector register length must be at least 64 bits
description: |
  The Zvl64b extension requires the implementation to have a vector register
  length (VLEN) of at least 64 bits.

  The Zvl*b extensions are a family of extensions that specify minimum vector
  register lengths. They allow software to determine the minimum VLEN supported
  by an implementation without needing to probe at runtime.

  With VLEN=64 and the smallest supported SEW of 8 bits, the minimum VLMAX
  is 8 elements (with LMUL=1).
