kind: extension
name: Zve64x
long_name: Vector Extension for Minimal Vector Register Length of 64 Bits
description: |
  The Zve64x extension provides support for vector integer operations with a
  maximum element width (ELEN) of 64 bits. This is a base embedded vector
  extension that excludes floating-point vector operations.

  Zve64x includes all functionality of Zve32x plus:

  * Support for 64-bit integer vector elements (SEW=64)
  * 64-bit vector load and store instructions
  * All vector integer instructions operating on 64-bit elements

  Zve64x excludes all vector floating-point instructions and does not require
  implementation of the F or D extensions.

  This extension is intended for embedded processors that need 64-bit vector
  integer operations but do not require floating-point support.
