long_name: Vector Extension for Minimal Double-Precision Embedded Floating-Point
description: |
  The Zve64d extension adds double-precision vector floating-point support to
  the Zve64f embedded vector extension. The maximum element width (ELEN) is
  64 bits, supporting 64-bit integer and 64-bit double-precision floating-point
  elements.

  Zve64d includes all functionality of Zve64f plus:

  * Double-precision vector floating-point instructions
  * Double-precision vector floating-point reductions
  * Vector floating-point conversion instructions between single and double precision

  Zve64d requires the D (double-precision floating-point) extension.

  This extension provides the full embedded vector floating-point capability
  with support for both single and double precision operations.
