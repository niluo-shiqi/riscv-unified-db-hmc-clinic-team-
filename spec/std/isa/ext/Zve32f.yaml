kind: extension
name: Zve32f
long_name: Vector Extension for Minimal Single-Precision Embedded Floating-Point
description: |
  The Zve32f extension adds single-precision vector floating-point support to
  the Zve32x base embedded vector extension. The maximum element width (ELEN)
  remains 32 bits.

  Zve32f includes all functionality of Zve32x plus:

  * Single-precision vector floating-point instructions
  * Vector floating-point reductions
  * Vector floating-point compare and classify instructions

  Zve32f requires the F (single-precision floating-point) extension.

  This extension is intended for embedded processors that need both vector
  integer and single-precision floating-point operations.
