kind: extension
name: Zve64f
long_name: Vector Extension for Minimal Single-Precision Embedded Floating-Point
description: |
  The Zve64f extension adds single-precision vector floating-point support to
  the Zve64x base embedded vector extension. The maximum element width (ELEN)
  is 64 bits, supporting both 64-bit integer and 32-bit floating-point elements.

  Zve64f includes all functionality of Zve64x and Zve32f plus:

  * Single-precision vector floating-point instructions with 64-bit integer support
  * Support for widening floating-point operations up to 64-bit integers

  Zve64f requires the F (single-precision floating-point) extension.

  This extension is intended for embedded processors that need 64-bit vector
  integer operations and single-precision floating-point support.
