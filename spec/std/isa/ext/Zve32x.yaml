kind: extension
name: Zve32x
long_name: Vector Extension for Minimal Vector Register Length of 32 Bits
description: |
  The Zve32x extension provides support for vector integer operations with a
  maximum element width (ELEN) of 32 bits. This is a base embedded vector
  extension that excludes floating-point vector operations.

  Zve32x includes:

  * All vector load and store instructions
  * All vector integer instructions
  * All vector fixed-point arithmetic instructions
  * All vector mask instructions
  * All vector permutation instructions
  * Vector integer reduction instructions

  Zve32x excludes all vector floating-point instructions and does not require
  implementation of the F extension.

  This extension is intended for embedded processors that need vector
  operations but do not require floating-point support.
