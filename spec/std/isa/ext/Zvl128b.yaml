kind: extension
name: Zvl128b
long_name: Vector register length must be at least 128 bits
description: |
  The Zvl128b extension requires the implementation to have a vector register
  length (VLEN) of at least 128 bits.

  The Zvl*b extensions are a family of extensions that specify minimum vector
  register lengths. They allow software to determine the minimum VLEN supported
  by an implementation without needing to probe at runtime.

  VLEN=128 is the minimum vector register length required by the full V
  extension. With VLEN=128 and SEW=8 bits, VLMAX is 16 elements (with LMUL=1).
