description: |
  Each reduction operator computes an exact sum using an ideal scalar
  floating-point addition, then converts that result into a floating-
  point format with range and precision at least as large as the element
  SEW, rounding with the current dynamic rounding mode and raising
  exceptions as needed. Implementations may choose the exact range and
  precision per operator.
