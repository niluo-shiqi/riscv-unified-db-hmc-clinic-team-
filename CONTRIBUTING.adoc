== Submitting a Pull Request

All patches must meet the UnifiedDB code standards. This includes:

* Pass regression tests
** run locally as `./bin/regress --all`...though this will take a while to run sequentially. These will also run in GitHub automatically.
* Use appropriate commit messages
* Go through code review as a Pull Request

=== Regression tests

All contributions must pass the full suite of regression tests.
Tests are documented more in xref:doc/ci.adoc[Continuous Integration].

=== Commit messages

We use a squash merge policy for PRs. The commit message that appears in main is the PR title and description, and reviewers will ask that those are brief but descriptive. We also strive to follow https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0[Conventional Commits v1.0.0], though that is not enforced.

==== Linked Issues and PRs

When a commit will close a GitHub Issue, it should be noted in the PR description.

```
Fixes #<issue number>
Closes #<issue number>
```

=== Code review

All Pull Requests must go through the code review process.

All Pull Requests require approval by at least one Code Owner.

Code Owners are maintained in `.github/CODEOWNERS`.

== Finding tasks

If you are looking to contribute but are unsure what to do, browse through the https://github.com/riscv/riscv-unified-db/issues[issues]. We try to keep them tagged by area and mark easier tasks with "good first issue".
